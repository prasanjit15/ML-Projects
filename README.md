# ML-Models

This repo consists of all my ML-projects.

The list of the projects are below:
 ## 1. Credarove  
        This is a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.

        - First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.
        - We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.
        - We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
        - After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
        - Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.

## 2. Generify
       This is a machine learning model to classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock'. 
       +-----------------+
       | Steps followed: |
       +-----------------+
       
       - First, We load the metadata about our tracks alongside the track metrics compiled by The Echo Nest.
       - Then, we perform PCA on our data.
       - After that we train a Decision Tree Classifier to classify the genres.
       - Then we train a Logistic Regression so as to compare which classifier performs better.
       - Now, we balance our data for a greater performance.
       - Finall we used Cross-Validation to evaluate our models.
